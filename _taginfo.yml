advice:
  I rarely give direct advice, because we don't know each other&rsquo;s lives
  and my context undoubtedly differs from yours.  However, I occasionally talk
  about ideas that worked or flopped for my life that <i>may</i> transfer to
  yours.
announcement:
  When I launch projects, regardless of their licensing, you&rsquo;ll find
  a post about it here.
blog:
  To the presumed surprise of nobody, these posts deal with the blog, other
  than routine improvements to the system.
bookclub:
  The &ldquo;Free Culture Book Club&rdquo; series explores works of
  fiction released under public licenses compatible with a
  <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative
  Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International</a> license (with
  occasional exceptions), with an eye towards helping to improve or adapt parts
  of the project.  Read the background for the project in
  <a href="/blog/2020/05/02/freeculture.html">introductory post</a>.
  <br><br>
  Why a &ldquo;book club&rdquo; when we don&rsquo;t always cover books?  Book
  clubs and reading circles arose from barring women from higher education, and
  so often has a gendered stigma that I'd like to help fix.  But also, I want to
  encourage discussion of the works, in a way that presenting them or reviewing
  them can't.  I provide my opinions, but would rather readers check out the
  work and tell me and other readers what they (you) think.
books:
  I enjoy books, and sometimes need to talk about them in general terms.
  Don&rsquo;t expect to find many reviews, though.  I usually save my thoughts
  on individual books for
  <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag">my newsletter</a>, along with
  other items.
closereading:
  These posts focus on careful review of source material to draw out the
  details, ideally without considering what others have said about the source.
devjournal:
  My developer diary posts&mdash;formerly referred to as developer
  journals&mdash;review the public-facing work that I&rsquo;ve done over the
  prior week.  While originally named after what I worked on or the time of
  year, I have since adapted the idea to work off holidays or other events on
  the Monday of release, to minimize the number of indistinguishable titles.
education:
  I taught for many years in parallel to various day jobs, and also enjoy
  learning new things.  When I want to teach myself or others something novel,
  or maybe talk about the educational value of a tool, those posts will end
  up here.
fiction:
  Not as often as I would like, I write the odd work of fiction to satisfy
  some gap that I see in discourse and can pull together in a short run.
  It also includes the occasional short public domain work that I found
  interesting, including the occasional translation.
freeculture:
  In contrast to the <a href="/blog/tag/bookclub">Free Culture Book Club</a>
  posts, posts marked &ldquo;Free Culture&rdquo; also include all my writing
  related to Free Culture works, including fiction that I wrote and general
  ideas about the movement.
indieweb:
  This tag helps track the sporadic progress on integrating
  <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indie Web</a> features with the blog.
letsfix:
  An infrequent series, where I (usually) consider what it would take to get
  a famous brand &ldquo;right,&rdquo; and least for the parts of the idea
  that I find important or prominent.
linkdump:
  I post links and quotes to Mastodon (and pre-&#x1D54F; Twitter) on a
  semi-automated schedule, the most interesting of what I found during the
  prior week.  On Fridays, I package the contents of those posts up for these
  weekly &ldquo;link dumps.&rdquo;
media:
  While I don't have the expertise (or pretension) to call myself a
  &ldquo;media theorist,&rdquo; I do frequently think about how mass media
  works and where it goes wrong.
newyear:
  I have made the new year a minor celebration for the blog, taking a moment
  beforehand to look back on the previous year, and another after to look
  ahead to the incoming year.
oopsie:
  These posts provided incorrect information in such an unrecoverable way
  that they needed to come down, such as pointing to a project as Free Culture
  when the creator hasn't released it under any public license.
programming:
  I write a fair bit of code, and these posts include project updates, tips
  that I picked up at the time, thoughts on the field, and so forth.
programminglanguages:
  If you know me &ldquo;from the Internet,&rdquo; then it might come from my
  work in small, hobbyist, &ldquo;esoteric&rdquo; (I never liked the word)
  languages.  If you know me in person, then you might have taken one of my
  programming languages classes.  In either case, these posts touch on those
  experiences.
quora:
  For a few years starting in 2014, I spent a lot of time on question-and-answer
  site <a href="https://quora.com">Quora</a>, writing thousands of answers on
  various topics.  Every once in a while, I pull from that pile of answers and
  update them as a blog post.
politics:
  When I need to talk about how people with power have gotten things wrong,
  how I think we need to fix certain societal issues, or the definitions of
  words that certain people seem interested in misrepresenting, those posts
  end up here.
rant:
  When the odds point to the post growing out of control as I rage at the
  skies, it gets a &ldquo;Rant&rdquo; label&hellip;
recipe:
  I experiment fairly often with my cooking.  When such an experiment pans
  out well, I provide a loose, improvisational recipe in the Monday
  <a href="/blog/tag/devjournal">developer diary</a> post, also tagging them
  so that you can find <i>only</i> the posts where I talk food.
socialshowdown:
  The Free Software Social Networking Showdown ran in the early days of the
  blog, looking at the social networks that run on Free Software.  It tries
  to cover the on-boarding, general user experience, and community, plus my
  gut reactions after working with the network for a while.
startrek:
  The &ldquo;Real Life in Star Trek&rdquo; series tries to tease out
  information on the culture of the United Federation of Planets in
  the background of the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise, relying on the evidence
  in the primary sources, as opposed to nostalgia or another analysis.  See
  the background on the project in
  <a href="/blog/2020/01/02/trek-00.html">the introductory post</a>.
superhero:
  I grew up on superheroes&mdash;comic books, cartoons, toys, live-action
  television and film&mdash;and still occasionally have thoughts about the
  milieu.
techtips:
  Once in a while, I have a small problem with some regularity that has a
  drop-in solution.  Traditionally, I wrote notes to myself, somewhere, and
  then needed to hunt down the right note when I need the information next
  time through a project.  Predictably, that doesn't work, so I started
  writing them as short blog posts, instead, which <i>you</i> can fail to find
  when you need them, too&hellip;
