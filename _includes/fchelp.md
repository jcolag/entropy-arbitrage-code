As mentioned previously, by the way, the list of potential works to discuss has run low, so I need to ask for help, again.  If you know of any works that fit these posts---fictional, contains some narrative, Free Culture, available to the public, and not by creators who we've already discussed---please tell me about them.  Every person who points me to at least one appropriate work with an explanation will receive a free membership on [my Buy Me a Coffee page](https://buymeacoffee.com/jcolag).  (By all means, promote your own work if relevant, or create something under an appropriate license for the *purpose* of promoting your own work.)
