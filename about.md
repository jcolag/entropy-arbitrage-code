Welcome to **Entropy Arbitrage**, John Colagioia's blog!  This serves as an irregular series of posts that try to centralize things that I work on or have written.  For more details, you'll probably want to read my [introductory post]({% post_url 2019-12-08-greetings %}).

The title refers to the idea that disorder has uses in some situations, but shows in abundance in other situations.  That balance and exchange between ordered and disordered systems have grown into something of an obsession for me for many years.  Some systems need more order, some less.

If you made it this far and are worried about the irregular schedule, you may want to <span class="rss-subscribe"><a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | relative_url }}">Subscribe <i class="fas fa-rss"></i></a></span> to the RSS feed.  And if you find yourself wanting to support the various projects described in here, then you might want to check out the [store](/store), which admittedly mostly points you to other sites, because who actually wants to develop the software to do this right?

A bio?  Sure, if we must...

 > A born and bred Long Islander who doesn't have an accent that you expect, John (he/him) has been programming since the BASIC cartridge on the Atari 400 and used a Commodore 64 from around its release until high school made forty-column printouts an untenable plan.  He has been programming professionally long enough that some of his colleagues weren't born when he started out, and feels pleased to see a generation of programmers who learned with a community.  He has worked in telecommunications, medicine, productivity, research, home automation, transit, e-commerce, and other spaces, and tried to bring the lessons of each field to the others.  He has also used a wide variety of technologies in these jobs, and has gotten a laugh seeing most of them horribly misused.

 > John has also taught everything from graduate courses to continuing education, ran and occasionally still runs a startup without acquiring enough customers to survive (oops!), and dabbled in publishing in a venture that never came together (oops again!).  He *probably* won't take your consulting job unless he likes you or finds the project of special interest, but feel free to pitch something.

 > You can find John's ramblings on the Internet going back to the early 1990s on a wide variety of topics, if you search thorougly enough, and will find that he has had some *spectacularly* bad ideas about how the world works and now spends a fair amount of time trying to make up for that.  If you see him acting particularly dismissive of an idea (other than a blatant lie or long-obsolete), it probably comes from having previously talked that way and now realizes how inane that sounds.

And now I tire of looking at third-person prose, so scram.  Go read something else or play outside or something...

Oh, if you're looking for something like my résumé, I generally keep [this copy](/resume.html) up to date and [my main homepage](/) has links to most of the networks where you can find my digital footprint, including archives of activity on platforms that I no longer use or that no longer exist.
